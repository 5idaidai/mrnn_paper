\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-1em}

We propose a multimodal Recurrent Neural Network (m-RNN) framework that performs at the state-of-the-art in three tasks: sentence generation, sentence retrieval given query image and image retrieval given query sentence.
Our m-RNN can be extended to use more complex image features (e.g. object detection features) and more sophisticated language models.
% In the future work, we will try to incorporate more powerful language models and image feature extraction networks into our framework and try it on larger datasets.
